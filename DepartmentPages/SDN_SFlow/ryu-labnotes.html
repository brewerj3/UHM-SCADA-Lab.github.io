<h2>RYU SDN Controller</h2>
<p>
  Ryu is pronounced "ree-yooh".<br>
  Installation location: /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/ryu<br>
  <a href="https://book.ryu-sdn.org/en/Ryubook.pdf">RYU Book</a>
</p>

<h2>Application Process</h2>
<div class="list">
  <ol>
    <li>Started off copying an example program provided by Ryu. Located at '~/ryu/ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py'</li>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="ryu_example.html">Ryu Example Program</a> with commentary</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Ended off Spring 2022 semester with file located at '~/ryu_tests/ryu427.py'</li>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="ryu27.html">Ryu - April 27th</a> with commentary</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Current Progress (as of 11/17/22)</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Added a check if the source and destination port are the same, then return.</li>
      <li>Implemented a way to remove flows from switch, replacing the hard timeout that was used as a placeholder last semester.</li>
      <li>Transitioned from Ryu to OS-Ken, which is essentially an actively maintained version of Ryu. </li>
      <li>Created custom programs to parse the packet data.</li>
      <li>Determined that the following arguments cannot be used with OFPMatch (in the hardware table):
        <ol>
          <li>in_phy_port (Switch physical input port)</li>
          <li>eth_dst (Ethernet destination address)</li>
          <li>arp_spa (ARP source IPv4 address)</li>
          <li>arp_tpa (ARP target IPv4 address)</li>
          <li>arp_op (ARP opcode)</li>
          <li>arp_sha (ARP source hardware address)</li>
          <li>arp_tha (ARP target hardware address)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

<h2>Launching RYU</h2>
<div>
  <p>In a terminal window:</p>
  <p class="fw-lighter">$ ryu-manager /path/to/application.py</p>
  <p>This launches the ryu controller application where /path/to/application.py should be replaced by the application you wish to launch. You can also pass the argument --help to see other passable arguments. Our current path to the python file is '~/ryu_test/', with the current version (as of 9/13) the python file 'ryu913.py'.</p>

  <p>To launch with GUI:</p>
  <p class="fw-lighter">$ ryu-manager --observe-links ~/ryu/ryu/app/gui_topology/gui_topology.py /path/to/application.py</p>
</div>

<h2>Mininet</h2>
<div>
  <p>To test RYU via mininet, launch mininet as follows:</p>
  <p class="fw-lighter">
    $ sudo mn -c <br>
    $ sudo mn --controller=remote <br>
  </p>
  <p>Where the -c argument cleans mininet and is generally recommended to get rid of past flows/data. The second line launches mininet with a remote controller. We generally followed this <a href="https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Learn-Development-Tools">tutorial to set up mininet.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>HP 2420-24G Switch</h2>
<p>
  If you get a program working within mininet, chances are it won't immediately work with our physical switch (and vice versa). <br>
  <br>
  However, this is (hopefully) no need for panic. <br>
  <br>
  Since the default table_id for mininet (OpenvSwitch) and the <a href="https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofproto_v1_3_ref.html#ryu.ofproto.ofproto_v1_3_parser.OFPFlowMod">OFPFlowMod</a> is table_id=0, meaning that the provided example <a href="https://github.com/faucetsdn/ryu/tree/master/ryu/app">programs</a> should work in mininet without change. <br>
  <br>
  For the HP2420-24G switch, flow table 0 is defaulted to the start table, flow table 100 is the hardware table (which can only accept flows with certain <a href="https://community.hpe.com/t5/Software-Defined-Networking/Using-Hardware-flows-table-with-hp-2920-24g/td-p/6931454#.YlypyNrMKUk">matches</a>), and flow table 200 is the software table. <br>
  <br>
  To specify idle/hard timeouts in addFlow messages to the switch, the controller has to have timeouts of 0 (aka infinite) for the flow that gets created during the handshake. All other timeouts are just an integer (in seconds). <br>
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
  Ryu is programmed via the use of python scripts. <br>
  There are a bunch of examples on the <a href="https://github.com/faucetsdn/ryu/tree/master/ryu/app">github</a>, along with pretty good <a href="https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">documentation here</a>.<br>
</p>

<h2>Learning Switch</h2>
<p>
  As I understand, the idea of a learning switch is:<br>
  A packet arrives at a switch, the switch asks the SDN controller what to do with it. <br>
  <div class="list">
  <ol>
  <li>The controller creates a dictionary of the datapath and what the source Mac address and the source port is.</li>
  <li>The controller then checks if the datapath:destination Mac address port is in the previous list.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If so, install a flow so that next time the switch doesn't bother the controller, and tell the switch to send the packet to that destination port.</li>
    <li>If not, broadcast the packet to all ports, but you already wrote down the source mac address, so eventually you will gain a dictionary of many addresses, which you will eventually auto convert to flows.</li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
